# Storybook Framework Qwik

This is a framework to allow using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) with [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/).

## Limitations

- This has only been tested with a brand new Qwik application project (not tested with a component library, or without qwik-city)
- Stories do not update when component is changed
